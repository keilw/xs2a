# Release notes v. 1.17

## Bugfix: not able to retrieve the payment by redirect id when psu-id is not set in the initial request
When retrieving the payment by redirect id (endpoint GET /psu-api/v1/pis/consent/redirects/{redirect-id} in consent-management) now there is no need
to provide psu data and the payment can be retrieved without it, only by redirect id and instance id.

This also applies for getting payment for cancellation (endpoint GET /psu-api/v1/payment/cancellation/redirect/{redirect-id} in consent-management)

## Bugfix: Remove PSU Data from endpoint for getting consent by redirect id in CMS-PSU-API
PSU Data is no longer required for getting consent by redirect id.
As a result, headers `psu-id`, `psu-id-type`, `psu-corporate-id` and `psu-corporate-id-type` are no longer used in `psu-api/v1/ais/consent/redirect/{redirect-id}` endpoint.
PsuIdData was also removed as an argument from `de.adorsys.psd2.consent.psu.api.CmsPsuAisService#checkRedirectAndGetConsent` method.

## Delete old 'tpp demo' 
Deleted extra functional in 'tpp-demo' package
