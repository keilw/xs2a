# Release notes v. 1.16

## Bugfix: not able to retrieve the payment by redirect id when psu-id is not set in the initial request
When retrieving the payment by redirect id (endpoint GET /psu-api/v1/pis/consent/redirects/{redirect-id} in consent-management) now there is no need
to provide psu data and the payment can be retrieved without it, only by redirect id and instance id.

This also applies for getting payment for cancellation (endpoint GET /psu-api/v1/payment/cancellation/redirect/{redirect-id} in consent-management)
